   One day, when I was 7 years old, I wanted to create a website called Compy The Computer. Every day, I used to go there and see my statistics. Then, in 2019 I subscribed to too many services and I deleted my Gmail account. That Gmail account was also used to access my Compy The Computer web manager, so I lost it. Then, my brother and I (MikeBike#6757) subscribed to a swimming course. So we had loads of fun back then, but we didn’t go anymore because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2020, I made a YouTube channel called Compy The Computer, where I showed how to fix technical problems, I had 50 views on my most viewed video. In May of 2020, we started going out by ourselves. We started going to the park, we made new friends and all of that good stuff. When winter arrived, it was too cold to go out any longer, so we stayed home with our parents. In winter of 2021, I made my YouTube channel called: guess what? Villager Boy! Then, when 2022 started, we got Discord! And then, we subscribed to Twitch because my YouTube channel got hacked. Then, on the 6th of June (2022), I recovered Compy The Computer. That’s where we are now!
