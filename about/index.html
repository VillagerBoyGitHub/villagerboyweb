   One day, when I was 7 years old, I wanted to create a website called Compy The Computer.<br> Every day, I used to go there and see my statistics.<br> Then, in 2019 I subscribed to too many services and I deleted my Gmail account.<br> That Gmail account was also used to access my Compy The Computer web manager, so I lost it.<br> Then, my brother and I (MikeBike#6757) subscribed to a swimming course.<br> So we had loads of fun back then, but we didn’t go anymore because of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br> In January 2020, I made a YouTube channel called Compy The Computer, where I showed how to fix technical problems; I had 50 views on my most viewed video.<br> In May of 2020, we started going out by ourselves. We started going to the park, we made new friends and all of that good stuff.<br> When winter arrived, it was too cold to go out any longer, so we stayed home with our parents.<br> In winter of 2021, I made my YouTube channel called: guess what? Villager Boy!<br> Then, when 2022 started, we got Discord!<br> And then, we subscribed to Twitch because my YouTube channel got hacked.<br> Then, on the 6th of June (2022), I recovered Compy The Computer.<br> That’s where we are now!
